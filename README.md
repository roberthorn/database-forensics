# COMP5350 Digital Forensics Term Paper: Database Forensics

Term paper for my Digital Forensics class discussing techniques and issues dealing with forensic investigations of relational database systems, specifically Oracle database systems. 

## Abstract

Database forensics is still a relatively new branch of digital forensics. This can be due to the high complexity of relational database management systems or the major differences between these systems. But the number of security breaches of database systems is increasing, giving incentive to study the subject more closely. In this paper, we discuss areas of importance dealing with database forensics as well as techniques to use during a forensic investigation of a relational database management system with specific focus on Oracle database systems.
